## Motivation

During participants setup their presentation for the SCB TechX's Hackathon pitching. I found that some of their desktop has plenty of screenshots, folders or some files that unnecessary their
presentation. How might we have a single command or cli without an user has to remember the command or googling command to hide their desktop icons?

## Demo

![demo hide and show files with hide-files cli](./docs/demo.gif)

‚ö†Ô∏è This CLI supports only on macOS!

## Installation

First, install the cli

```bash
# npm
$ npm install -g hide-files

# yarn
$ yarn global add hide-files

# pnpm
$ pnpm add -g hide-files
```

## Usage

Then execute the command to hide your cluttered desktop icons ü§´

```bash
$ hide-files hide
```

Unhide all files and folders in Desktop

```bash
$ hide-files unhide
```
