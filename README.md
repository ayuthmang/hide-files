## Motivation

During participants setup their presentation for the SCB TechX's Hackathon pitching. I found that some of their desktop has plenty of screenshots, folders or some files that unnecessary their presentation. How might we have a single command or cli without an user has to remember the command or googling command to hide their desktop icons?

⚠️ This CLI supports only on macOS!

## Usage

Hide all files and folders in Desktop

```bash
$ hide-files hide
```

Unhide all files and folders in Desktop

```bash
$ hide-files unhide
```
