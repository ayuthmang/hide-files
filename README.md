## Motivation

During participants setup their presentation for the SCB TechX's Hackathon pitching. I found that some of their desktop has plenty of screenshots, folders or some files that unnecessary their presentation. How might we have a single command or cli without an user has to remember the command or googling command to hide their desktop icons?
